		<summary>A tool to specify unique Link Providers for each Site in Sitecore.</summary>
		<description>
			Allows a developer to specify the LinkProvider to use for individual Sitecore Sites.
			Allows a developer to specify the location of content Items that are shared across sites and provide the following functionality:

			1. Produce context site URLs for the shared content (removes /sitecore/content/... from the URL)
			2. Explicitly define what the "parent" page of shared content should be when it is shared on a site. (use to create breadcrumbs that make sense)
			3. Allow each Site defined in the web.config to shunt Sitecore media requests to a second defined Sitecore site on a different hostname.

			Example configuration files provided.
		</description>
		<releaseNotes>
			Fixed SharedContentItemResolver to only remove the first occurance of the flag folder name, was causing issues where the flag folder
			name was repeated somewhere deeper in the item path, like the item name. ex: /news/2015/great-news-for-dog-owners. Only the first occcurance
			of news will be removed.
