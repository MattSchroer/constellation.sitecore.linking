Instructions
============

Allows a developer to specify the LinkProvider to use for individual Sitecore Sites.
Allows a developer to specify the location of content Items that are shared across sites and provide the following functionality:

1. Produce context site URLs for the shared content (removes /sitecore/content/... from the URL)
2. Explicitly define what the "parent" page of shared content should be when it is shared on a site. (use to create breadcrumbs that make sense)

Use the provided configuration files as an example.

1. Change the default link provider to SwitchingLinkProvider
2. Add SwitchingLinkProvider to the list of providers
3. Add Sites to the LinkProviderSwitching.config

I recommend finding a default that applies to most sites and only placing exceptions in the LinkProviderSwitching config file. See the
provided example, which uses SharedContentLinkProvider as the default and uses Sitecore's native LinkProvider for the Sitecore sites.
