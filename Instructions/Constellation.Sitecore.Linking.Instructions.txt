What it does
------------
Allows a developer to specify the LinkProvider to use for individual Sitecore Sites.
Provides a way to specify the location of content Items that are shared across sites:
	1. Produces context site URLs for the shared content (removes /sitecore/content/... from the URL)
	2. Explicitly defines what the "parent" page of shared content should be when it is shared on a site. (use to create breadcrumbs that make sense)
	3. Allow each Site defined in the web.config to shunt Sitecore media requests to a second defined Sitecore site on a different hostname.

Configuration
-------------
Use the provided configuration files as an example.

1. Change the default link provider to SwitchingLinkProvider
2. Add SwitchingLinkProvider to the list of providers
3. Add Sites to the LinkProviderSwitching.config
4. Change the default MediaProvider to the included MediaLinkProvider.
5. Add a "media" site definition (use the included sites.config as an example).
6. Add "mediaHostName" attributes to Sitecore site definitions to further customize the solution.

for switching link providers, I recommend finding a default link provider that applies to most sites and only placing exceptions in the 
LinkProviderSwitching config file. See the provided example, which uses SharedContentLinkProvider as the default and uses Sitecore's 
native LinkProvider for the Sitecore sites.
